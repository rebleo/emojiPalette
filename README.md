* run all the emojis through  pixel-code and organize the data set accordingly.

DATA VISUALIZE the whole thing in so many ways.
shiffman had great insight about
looking for biases and representing our findings visually.
I see color wheels, rainbows, categories, people of/and their colors, this PROOF OF CONCEPT stage is wide for awesome projects/scripts - anything we can think of.

## further steps:
Draw to canvas? Do we want to figure out how to do this ourselves or build on https://github.com/iamcal/js-emoji ?
FUNCTION time, this is a time where we create the "tools" the palette, the thing we want to then, SHARE
