# emojiPalette

project by [aarÃ³n montoya-moraga](https://github.com/aamontoya89), [eve weinberg](https://github.com/evejweinberg),[rebecca (marks) leopold](https://github.com/rebleo), [xiwei huang](https://github.com/thisisXiweiHuang).

- a & r met with ds. we are VERY excited (or r is as she uses the 'we' as she writes this). going to have to take this project one step at a time. Right now: it's DATA time.

To do now: DATA SET(s)
	- we need to scrape emoji data from here: http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
	a table that contains png links to ALL the different emojis AND the different ways they appear on each company's platform. for now i think just getting one emoji-image per unicode string is fine for now.

	My goal is that the data set includes the string information & the image/pixel information. In this way this tool (or whatever) can be flexible in terms of how and where it's implemented. Imagine a thing that is both a word AND an image -- so powerful, so cute: so? Emojis.

	ISSUES - so much data! i tried doing this myself in python and it's too slow not to do locally. going to look at this more before our meeting on Wed.

nxt steps:
	-once we figure out how to create data set we need to run it through the pixel-code and organize the data set accordingly.

	-then we can DATA VISUALIZE the whole thing in so many ways. ds had great insight about looking for biases and representing our findings visually. I see color wheels, rainbows, categories, people of/and their colors, this PROOF OF CONCEPT stage is wide for awesome projects/scripts - anything we can think of.

later steps:
	-Draw to canvas? Do we want to figure out how to do this ourselves or build on https://github.com/iamcal/js-emoji ? 
	-FUNCTION time, this is a time where we create the "tools" the palette, the thing we want to then,
	-SHARE

Please feel free to add to this or ask questions. let's clarify nxt steps, goals, etc at our meeting.
