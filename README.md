# emojiPalette

project by [aarÃ³n montoya-moraga](https://github.com/aamontoya89), [eve weinberg](https://github.com/evejweinberg),[rebecca (marks) leopold](https://github.com/rebleo), [xiwei huang](https://github.com/thisisXiweiHuang).

To do now: DATA SET(s)
	we need to scrape emoji data from here: http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
r made some progress. 

nxt steps:
figure out how to strip & organize data. How to access links embeded in data table. save to local? create server?
figure out how to build out an API for us to use
run all the emojis through  pixel-code and organize the data set accordingly. 

create API for general use

DATA VISUALIZE the whole thing in so many ways. shiffman had great insight about looking for biases and representing our findings visually. I see color wheels, rainbows, categories, people of/and their colors, this PROOF OF CONCEPT stage is wide for awesome projects/scripts - anything we can think of.

later steps:
Draw to canvas? Do we want to figure out how to do this ourselves or build on https://github.com/iamcal/js-emoji ?
FUNCTION time, this is a time where we create the "tools" the palette, the thing we want to then, SHARE

Please feel free to add to this or ask questions. let's clarify nxt steps, goals, etc at our meeting.
