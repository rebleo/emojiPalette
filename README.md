-a & r met with ds. we are VERY excited. Right now: it's DATA time.

To do now: DATA SET(s)
	we need to scrape emoji data from here: http://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html
	a table that contains png links to ALL the different emojis AND the different ways they appear on each company's platform. for now i think just getting one emoji-image per unicode string is fine for now.

My goal is that the data set includes the string information & the image/pixel information. In this way this tool (or whatever) can be flexible in terms of how and where it's implemented. Imagine a thing that is both a word AND an image -- so powerful, so cute: so? Emojis.

ISSUES - so much data! i tried doing this myself in python and it's too slow not to do locally. going to look at this more before our meeting on Wed.

nxt steps:
once we figure out how to create data set we need to run it through the pixel-code and organize the data set accordingly.

then we can DATA VISUALIZE the whole thing in so many ways. ds had great insight about looking for biases and representing our findings visually. I see color wheels, rainbows, categories, people of/and their colors, this PROOF OF CONCEPT stage is wide for awesome projects/scripts - anything we can think of.

later steps:
Draw to canvas? Do we want to figure out how to do this ourselves or build on https://github.com/iamcal/js-emoji ?
FUNCTION time, this is a time where we create the "tools" the palette, the thing we want to then, SHARE

Please feel free to add to this or ask questions. let's clarify nxt steps, goals, etc at our meeting.
